# Samples

This page provides longer text blocks to exercise search and highlight behavior.

## Sample A

Docfind indexes documents and returns ranked results. The results include a title, category, and href. A query for "index" should match this paragraph and the guide.

## Sample B

The component renders a search input and a list of results. The highlight markup wraps matched terms, which makes a query like "component" easier to scan.

## Sample C

Search is executed in the browser using the generated index and WebAssembly module. For a query like "wasm" or "WebAssembly", the results should include this section.

## Sample D

This section repeats a few terms: component, component, highlight, highlight, index, index. Repetition helps confirm ranking and score accumulation during search.
